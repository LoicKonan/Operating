## Program 03 - Paged memory

### Loic Konan

### Description

> Your assignment consists of designing and implementing a program that<br>
> will analyze the use of a paged memory system. Your program will read<br>
> the file available for download and identify the virtual pages accessed<br>
> in that file, reporting the total number of different pages and the average<br>
> access of each page. The size of a page is 4096 bytes and the addresses recorded<br>
> in the file are byte addresses. The data file has 1 million addresses. Your program will<br>
> accept several records of input data, according to the following format.<br>
>
> - **Hints:** An example of the analysis:
> - assuming only 10 pages were read and they were 1,9,2,1,1,1,9,3,1,9, would
> - result in total pages used 4 (pages 1,2,3 and 9) and average number of accesses was 2.5
