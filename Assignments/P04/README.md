## Program 03 - Memory programing by using pthreads

### Loic Konan

### Description

> - Create a pthreaded array calculator. 
> - The calculator must be able to perform the typical traditional arithmetic operations, such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division.
> - Arrays a, and b are integer arrays, with 1â€™000.000 million integers each.
> - All the elements in array a are 1, while all those in b are 2.
> - The addition function will create array "addition", in which addition[0] = a[0] + b[0], etc (You get the idea).
> - Follow a similar logic for substraction, multiplication and division.
>
> - Write a threaded program that uses four (4) threads.  In this program
> - Thread 0 will take care of the addition
> - Thread 1 susbtraction
> - Thread 2 multipliaction
> - Thread 3 division
