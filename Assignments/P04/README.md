## Program 03 - Memory programing by using pthreads

### Loic Konan

### Description

> - **Create a pthreaded array calculator**.
>
> - The calculator must be able to perform the typical traditional arithmetic operations:
>   - **Addition**.
>   - **Substraction**.
>   - **Multiplication**.
>   - **Division**.
>
> - **Arrays A, and B** are integers arrays, **_with 1000 000 integers_** each.
> - All the elements in _**Array A are 1**_, while all those in _**B are 2**_.
> - The addition function will create array **"Addition", in which addition[0] = a[0] + b[0]**, etc (You get the idea).
> - Follow a similar logic for **substraction, multiplication and division**.
>
> - Write a threaded program that uses four (4) threads.  In this program:
> 
>   - **Thread 0** Addition
>   - **Thread 1** Susbtraction
>   - **Thread 2** Multipliaction
>   - **Thread 3** Division
